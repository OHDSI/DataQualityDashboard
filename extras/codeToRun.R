cdmSourceName <- "Your CDM Source" # a human readable name for your CDM source
cdmVersion <- "5.4" # the CDM version you are targetting. Currently supports 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4

# determine how many threads (concurrent SQL sessions) to use ----------------------------------------
numThreads <- 1 # on Redshift, 3 seems to work well

# specify if you want to execute the queries or inspect them ------------------------------------------
sqlOnly <- FALSE # set to TRUE if you just want to get the SQL scripts and not actually run the queries
sqlOnlyIncrementalInsert <- FALSE # set to TRUE if you want the generated SQL queries to calculate DQD results and insert them into a database table (@resultsDatabaseSchema.@writeTableName)
sqlOnlyUnionCount <- 1  # in sqlOnlyIncrementalInsert mode, the number of check sqls to union in a single query; higher numbers can improve performance in some DBMS (e.g. a value of 25 may be 25x faster)

# NOTES specific to sqlOnly <- TRUE option ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. You do not need a live database connection.  Instead, connectionDetails only needs these parameters:
#      connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(
#        dbms = "", # specify your dbms
#        pathToDriver = "/"
#      )
# 2. Since these are fully functional queries, this can help with debugging.
# 3. In the results output by the sqlOnlyIncrementalInsert queries, placeholders are populated for execution_time, query_text, and warnings/errors; and the NOT_APPLICABLE rules are not applied.
# 4. In order to use the generated SQL to insert metadata and check results into output table, you must set sqlOnlyIncrementalInsert = TRUE.  Otherwise sqlOnly is backwards compatable with <= v2.2.0, generating queries which run the checks but don't store the results.
